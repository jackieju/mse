MSE
C-style mud/webgame script engine
1. This script syntax is inherit from C/java/javascript, it's easy to learn, easy to read, easy to maintain.
2. It support weak-type variable, you don't need define the type when declare a variable.
3. It's designed for huge concurrency runtime, so any object can be defined as "real global" accross multi-server.
If a variable is defined like:
	global world;
The object "world" wil be stored on global memcached cluster.
Every font web server will read/write it synchronizedly and safely.

In addition to above feature, I hope it can be a kind of light-wight and high-efficient programning language. ( So an template toolkit should be developled in the future)


Installation and development guide:

-------- MACOS & linuxe ------------

Make:
$ make -f makefile_macos

test mse:
$ cd bin
$ ./mse
change the main.cpp as you want to test, and rebuild again

test cgi from apache:
1. Modify the configuration file of your apache
$ vi /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf 

add line
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/Users/juweihua/studio/projects/WebMudFramework/ScriptEngine/mse/cgi-bin/"
in block
<IfModule alias_module>
...
</IfModule>

add lines
<Directory "/Users/juweihua/studio/projects/WebMudFramework/ScriptEngine/mse/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
Please change the position of cgi-bin folder to your own

2. start apache
$ /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
(The position where you installed apache maybe different)

3. access http://localhost/cgi-bin/cs.cgi from your browser
You can change cgi-bin/cs_cgi.cpp as you want

Add/Change syntax
The grammar is defined in cocoR/cs.atg, you can change it and run "make parser" then "make -f makefile_macos"
There is a "grep.pl" under cocoR folder, you can use it to see the clean grammar definition without code
